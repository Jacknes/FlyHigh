The registration form is processed by adding the new user to an XML. After the viewer is registered as a customer,
there are two options:
    - First option: The customer has performed a search on the “Main” page and obtained
        flight list as result then clicked register link. In this case, the registration form process
        takes the customer to the “Results” page at the Second Scenario.
    - Second option: The customer has not performed a search on the “Main” page. In this
        case, the registration process takes the customer to the “Main” page at the Second Scenario.
